## Description

> OpenMMO is currently in development and not yet ready for any real use.

OpenMMO is an open-source implementation of the PokeMMO server.
The goal is it to provide a free and open-source alternative to the PokeMMO server.

## Building

The map data is generated at build time from the [pret](https://github.com/pret)
decompilation projects, which are vendored as git submodules under `decomp/`.
Clone the repository with its submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <repo-url>
# or, for an existing clone:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Without the submodules the `:maps` build fails, because the generator has no
decomp data to read.

## Configuration

All local configuration and secrets live in a `.env` file at the repository
root. It is **gitignored**, never commit it. Use the tracked
[`.env.example`](.env.example) as the template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # then edit the values
docker compose up -d          # start all docker containers
./gradlew runAll              # build and run the servers
```

For local-only tweaks to the container setup, create a
`docker-compose.override.yml` (also gitignored). 
Docker Compose merges it automatically on `docker compose up`. 
For deployment,supply a proper `.env` and run `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d` to skip any override.
